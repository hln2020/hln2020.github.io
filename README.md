# Data Science Experience

## **Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center**
**Data Science Researcher (Sep. 2023 - Dec. 2023)**
### Cancer Drug Response Prediction through Knowledge Graph Embedding & Geometric Deep Learning
[Report](https://github.com/hln2020/TxGNN/blob/main/Group_40_Final_Report_NYU.pdf)  
- Constructed a knowledge graph of 3,217,941 triplets by synthesizing clinical & mutational profiles for 7 cancer types.
- Implemented RotatE, a **knowledge graph embedding** model, for graph augmentation & drug prediction.
- Executed the TxGNN architecture in **PyTorch** on NYU High Performance Computing clusters to predict triplets and generate therapeutic treatment recommendations for cancer patients, achieving 88% **AUROC**.

## **State-Backed Information Operations Analysis Using Pre-trained Transformer-Based Models (Sep. 2023 - Dec. 2023)**
[Github Repo](https://github.com/hln2020/state-backed-io)  
- Utilized **Matplotlib**, **Pandas**, **Numpy** in Python to drive understanding of Twitter’s user behavior such as location, language, percentage of tweets by user ID.
- Created tweet embeddings using **OpenAI’s API** and applied **K-means clustering** to identify themes and extract narratives within state-backed information operations.
- Fine-tuned a pre-trained **LLM** to classify tweets belonging to such operations, achieving a 97% validation accuracy.

## **Predicting Obesity from Lifestyle Characteristics of Latin American Population (Sep. 2022 - Dec 2022)**
[Github Repo](https://github.com/hln2020/Predicting-Obesity-Lifestyle)  
- Conducted data preprocessing and exploratory analysis using **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** to visualize factors affecting obesity such as age, sex, caloric consumption, physical activities.
- Applied hypothesis testing using **Chi-Square** and **Mann-Whitney U** tests to perform feature selection.
- Achieved a 79% accuracy in identifying critical factors contributing to obesity using **logistic regression**.

## **Video Frame Prediction & Image Segmentation Using Generative Adversarial Network & U-Net (Mar. 2024 - May. 2024)**
[Github Repo](https://github.com/hln2020/computer-vision)  
- Trained FutureGAN, a progressively **growing generative adversarial network** (GAN), on 13K videos to predict video frames on GPU, achieving a **MSE** of 0.0069 on validation set
- Collaborated with teammates on implementation of U-Net, a **convolutional neural network** generating segmentation masks for objects in predicted video frames

## **Large Language Models’ Cognitive Capabilities: A Study on OpenAI’s GPT Models (Mar 2023 - May 2023)**
[Github Repo](https://github.com/hln2020/gpt-cognitive-capabilities)  
- Conducted vignette-based investigations on **GPT-3.5** and **GPT-4’s** cognitive capabilities in decision-making, information search, deliberation, and causal reasoning using canonical scenarios from cognitive psychology.
- Applied prompt engineering on **GPT-3.5** and evaluated **GPT-3.5** and **GPT-4’s** performance compared to GPT-3.
- Identified the ability to handle adversaries as a weakness for current GPT models for future research purposes.
